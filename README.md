The work aims to define the necessity of a sustainability calculator for the global scenario.
At CCG, we have made a calculator to analyse the various sustainability indicators of different sectors, such as transport and  the power of a particular country/region.
There are levers to analyse the sustainability indicators.

One can visualise the dashboard by running the Visualisation_Pathcalc.ipynb file. The Dashboard is maintained through the Python package(PANEL) and Plotly.
